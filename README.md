# README-Generator

## Description
READMEs are crucial to the understanding of applications and how to utilize them. README-Generator is a Command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md from a user's input using answers to prompts presented using Inquirer.js. Each response is then utilized to fill out a template literal to create a README. The generated README includes a GitHub icon that links to an existing repository located using the submitted username and project title. README-Generator allows the user to spend more time and focus on building their own application and less on the README.

## Installation

Documentation for Inquirer.js can be found at https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer.
